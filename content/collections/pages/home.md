      Marshfield cricket club has been a cornerstone of Marshfield community 
      life for over 100 years, offering cricket and social opportunities for men, 
      women, boys and girls. Whether it is being the start of someone’s love for 
      cricket or attending one of the many community events at the club, it is at 
      the cricket club that village life really does matter. 

      Quite simply, Marshfield Cricket Club needs a new pavilion. This is not a 
      vanity project, the current pavilion is over 50 years old and each summer 
      we are thankful it is still standing for another season! This an ambitious 
      project but one needed for a growing and active community cricket club.

      Constructed in 1969, the existing pavilion is no longer fit for purpose. The 
      timber structure has no thermal capacity and poor, undersized facilities that  fail to meet the ECB requirements. The new proposals aim to bring the facility up to speed, making it suitable for hosting both the increased 
      quantity and standard of cricket, as well as the growing demand for 
      community events. A legacy, not only for the cricket club but for the village and community as well.
